# Site specific options should be given in a section where the section
# name is the entry point for urlsearch, i.e. the argv[0] value.
# As well as overriding the default options above, the 'site' and 'query'
# values can be specified.

# urlsearch matches the search format used by google and bind, so they don't
# appear in this config file, but google could appear as follows:
#[google]
#site = google.com
#query = search?q={terms}
#quote_plus = on
#hash_prefix_numbers = off

# Sets of options can be shared by creating a section with a single 'alias'
# option pointing to another section title.
